About the Game:

Aerial Swift is a java game to entertain the user. The user is given an option to pick one out of six characters. The
characters are Mario, Sonic, Campos, Spyro, and Pikachu. Once the character is chosen, the user must try to get past many 
pipes as they can without touching it. If they manage to make contact with any pipe, the game will be over. The number of pipes
the user passes is their score. In essence, the objective of the game is to pass through as many pipes as you can without 
touching or making contact with the pipes.
